# City Remove Spoiler

A Firefox extension that replaces all result spoilers from the replay section, to prevent you from knowing the result
before watching the match.

Extension removes the following:
* Page title (result is shown in the title bar of the browser)
* Index page listing all the matches you can view
* Heading title inside the selected match page
* Text descriptions inside the selected match page

Please note that the replacement is not instantaneous, as the page finishes rendering before replacement takes place.
Look away for a couple seconds while the page loads and the extension does its magic.
