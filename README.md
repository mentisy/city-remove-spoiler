# City Remove Spoiler

A Firefox extension that replaces all result spoilers from the replay section, to prevent you from knowing the result
before watching the match.

Extension removes the following:
* Page title (result is shown in the title bar of the browser)
* Index page listing all the matches you can view
* Heading title inside the selected match page

It does not remove:
* Text descriptions for the selected match. The description might mention a loss, draw og win.
  * Example: "Watch the full 90 minutes of City's dramatic win over Reading".

Please note that the replacement is not instantaneous, as the page finishes rendering before replacement takes place.
Look away for a couple seconds while the page loads and the extension does its magic.
